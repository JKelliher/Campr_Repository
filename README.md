## Campr Application

### Project Team:

### Vision Statement:
_To enrich and enable more camping, in better places, by providing a digital memoir of past experiences._

Campr is an application that stores campsite related data for users. The goal is to build a platform for users to track relavent information for each camp site they visit such as the campsite name, location (city, state) GPS coordinates, usage fees if applicable, user ratings etc. This will allow users to compile and navigate the campsites they have visited and plan future trips accordingly. A side effect of the pandemic was an increase in people camping and spending time outdoors. The best way to encourage new outdoorsmen to be successful in camping adventures as well as respectful and conscientious of camping etiquette is to make campsite information readily available! Our goals is to increase the availability of that information in an easy to use and crowd run platform to reach the most people and have the most up to date version of said information


### Motivation:
_There have been a lot of places we’ve camped in our lives. So many, that after a while, all we can remember is a faint feeling of joy or of time spent with family/friends in a great spot. What we can’t always remember are the specifics. Where exactly was the camp spot? What was the road like to get there (did I need a four wheel drive vehicle to get there)? What activities were nearby? Etc. A digital log of these places, with the ability to log details and photos can help us remember these awesome locations and revisit or recommend to new campers._


A member of the Campr project team recently aquired a camper trailer and realized there is not an All Trails-esque app availible that would allow users to track campsites they visit and rate them. All trails provides users the ability to track the trails they hike and find new trails to hike in the future. Campr would provide similar functionallity for campsites. Additionally many avid camping enthusiasts agree that there is lots of poor documentation  if any regarding campsites. Campr would allow gaps in campsite documentation to be filled in a community driven manner. As the popularity of camping continues to increase this app will have a growing target demographic to provide services to. 


### Project Risks:
Major risks to the project include the following:
1. This project will require the use of new languages and working environments
2. The team has no prior experience working together. Additonally the teammembers are located remotely throughout the Unites States.
3. There is a lack of some needed resources including a suitable Map API. 
4. Requirements for the application are in early draft phase (currently).
5. The team has varied and limited resource availability (Team members are working full time jobs and have other coursework obligations)
6. Required external APIs may have limited documentation or may be difficult to implement
7. There is risk that there is a lack of low cost or free resources to help build out the Campr Project.


### Mitigation Strategy:
Midigation for the risks listed above include the following:
1. Mitigate through basic implementations or through selecting languages with better fluency if possible
2. Mitigate through strong emphasis on regular communications via email, Discord, phone calls.
3. Mitigate through collaborative product requirements identification and documentation
4. Ensure stories are appropriately sized, we start with an MVP, and identify any features we’d like to implement early on in the process
5. Accept. This risk is unavoidable but all resources will work towards completion of assigned tasks


### Development Method:
Scrum will be utilized for the Campr project lifecycle and a Kanban-based tracking board, Trello, will be used to manage the team's biweekly sprint sessions.
* Biweekly standup scrum meetings will be held (as much as possible) to review what has been done, what will be done, and if there are any blockers. 
* On off weeks from scrum meetings, backlog grooming sessions will be held where the team will take features from the product requirements document and translate them into stories, and ensure the backlog is appropriately groomed.
* Every Monday/Wednesday/Friday (subject to change) the team will do online check ins to report what we’re planning on working on in the team’s discord channel, and communicate if members have any blockers or are running into any bugs
* Product requirements documentation will be developed to allow the team to understand, on a higher level, what the minimum viable product (mvp) will include and any features we’d like to add on if possible. This will be the document that is used to guide sprint planning. 


### Project Tracking Software:
Trello will be used to track progress to completion for the Campr project. Additional documentation (capacity planning, retro review) will be developed in Google sheets.
