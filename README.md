### Vision Statement:
Campr is an application that stores campsite related data for users. The goal is to build a platform for users to track relavent information for each camp site they visit such as the campsite namee, location (city, state) GPS coordinates, usage fees if applicable, user ratings etc. This will allow users to compile and navigate the campsites they have visited and plan future trips accordingly.


### Motivation:
A member of the Campr project team recently aquired a camper trailer and realized there is not an All Trails-esque app availible that would allow users to track campsites they visit and rate them. All trails provides users the ability to track the trails they hike and find new trails to hike in the future. Campr would provide similar functionallity for campsites. As the popularity of camping continues to increase this app will have a growing target demographic to provide services to.
