## Campr Application

### Project Team:
Matthew Martin\
Kelsey Kosnik\
Jacob Unger\
Joseph Kelliher


### Vision Statement:
Campr is an application that stores campsite related data for users. The goal is to build a platform for users to track relavent information for each camp site they visit such as the campsite namee, location (city, state) GPS coordinates, usage fees if applicable, user ratings etc. This will allow users to compile and navigate the campsites they have visited and plan future trips accordingly.


### Motivation:
A member of the Campr project team recently aquired a camper trailer and realized there is not an All Trails-esque app availible that would allow users to track campsites they visit and rate them. All trails provides users the ability to track the trails they hike and find new trails to hike in the future. Campr would provide similar functionallity for campsites. As the popularity of camping continues to increase this app will have a growing target demographic to provide services to. 


### Project Risks:
Major risks to the project include the following:
1. Team members have little to no experiance working together. Team members have various degrees of familiarity with the frameworks, programming languages etc. required for implementation of this application. Additionally team members are remote and located in different areas of the country.
2. Application will require a map API to provide a map based visual for campsites. Finding a cost appropriate (Free) API that has the required features may prove to be a challenge.
