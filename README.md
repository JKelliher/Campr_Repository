## Campr Application

### Project Team:
Matthew Martin\
Kelsey Kosnik\
Jacob Unger\
Joseph Kelliher


### Vision Statement:
_To enrich and enable more camping, in better places, by providing a digital memoir of past experiences._

Campr is an application that stores campsite related data for users. The goal is to build a platform for users to track relavent information for each camp site they visit such as the campsite name, location (city, state) GPS coordinates, usage fees if applicable, user ratings etc. This will allow users to compile and navigate the campsites they have visited and plan future trips accordingly. A side effect of the pandemic was an increase in people camping and spending time outdoors. The best way to encourage new outdoorsmen to be successful in camping adventures as well as respectful and conscientious of camping etiquette is to make campsite information readily available! Our goals is to increase the availability of that information in an easy to use and crowd run platform to reach the most people and have the most up to date version of said information


### Motivation:
A member of the Campr project team recently aquired a camper trailer and realized there is not an All Trails-esque app availible that would allow users to track campsites they visit and rate them. All trails provides users the ability to track the trails they hike and find new trails to hike in the future. Campr would provide similar functionallity for campsites. As the popularity of camping continues to increase this app will have a growing target demographic to provide services to. 


### Project Risks:
Major risks to the project include the following:
1. New language or working environment
2. No prior experience working with these team members
3. Lack of some needed resources
4. Fuzzy requirements (currently)
5. Limited resource availability (team members with jobs and other coursework)
6. Depending on external APIs, which may have limited documentation or may be difficult to implement
7. Lack of low cost or free resources to help build out our project


### Mitigation Strategy:
Midigation for the risks listed above include the following:
1. Mitigate through basic implementations or through selecting languages with better fluency if possible
2. Mitigate through strong emphasis on regular communications via email, Discord, phone calls.
3. Mitigate through collaborative product requirements identification and documentation
4. Ensure stories are appropriately sized, we start with an MVP, and identify any features we’d like to implement early on in the process
5. Accept. This risk is unavoidable but all resources will work towards completion of assigned tasks
 


### Development Method:
Scrum will be utilized for the Campr project lifecycle and a Kanban-based tracking board with Trello to manage the team's biweekly sprint sessions and kanban.

* Biweekly standup scrum meetings will be held (as much as possible) to review what has been done, what will be done, and if there are any blockers. 
* On off weeks from scrum meetings, backlog grooming sessions will be held where we will take features from our product requirements document and translate them into stories, and ensure the backlog is appropriately groomed
* Every Monday/Wednesday/Friday (can change this) we will do online check ins to report what we’re planning on working on in our team’s discord channel, and communicate if we have any blockers or running into any bugs
* Product requirements documentation will be developed to understand, on a higher level, what our minimum viable product (mvp) will include and any features we’d like to add on if possible. This will be our document that we use to guide sprint planning. 
* We will work off of a product requirements document in our scrum meetings to help keep the funnel of work full. 
* Trello will be utilized as our project tracking software and as such we will take advantage of it’s kanban type tracking board (the Trello board) to manage the flow of work. We will also try to actively work around both school and work schedules for all teams members in an attempt to minimize the stress of the project!




### Project Tracking Software:
Trello will be usedto track progress to completion for the Campr project. Additional documentation (capacity planning, retro review) will be developed in Google sheets.
