### Vision Statement:
Campr is an application that stores campsite related data for users. The goal is to build a platform for users to track relavent information for each camp site they visit such as the campsite namee, location (city, state) GPS coordinates, usage fees if applicable, user ratings etc. This will allow users to compile and navigate the campsites they have visited and plan future trips accordingly.
